# Digital Signal Processing Werkcollege
## Goal of the assignment
* Extraction of significant data points/intervals.

* Extract relative min and max using an adjustable threshold value: variable threshold A and B compared to the baseline.

* Normalize the data by substracting the offset: TIP: When the subject is in-air, the relative force applied should be zero.

* Add a graph that contains the sum of forceplate 1 and 2

* Calculate the impulse and height of the jump using the formulas in the summary.

* Link to the formulas: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/force-plate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/force-plate)
